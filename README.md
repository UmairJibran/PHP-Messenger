# PHP Messenger

You can read about it on Medium as well, here is the [link](https://medium.com/@umairjibran/messenger-in-php-from-scratch-ebb69dced62b) to my Medium Article about it!

## Requirements:
- XAMPP or any server of your choice!
- PHP 7.x
- Git (if you want to help improve it)
- Any of the following browser
  - Chrome
  - Firefox
  - Edge
  - Opera
  - Safari
  - ~Internet Explorer~ (Because I used Bootstrap 5, IE is no longer supported)

That's almost everything!
Am I missing a feature? PRs and Issues are welcome!
